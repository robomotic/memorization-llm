# LLM Memorization Detection Tool

This repository contains tools for measuring whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have memorized their training data, applicable to both open-source and closed-source models.

## Overview

Memorization in LLMs refers to the phenomenon where models directly reproduce content from their training data instead of generating novel responses. This tool provides multiple methods to detect such memorization, which is crucial for:

- Ensuring data privacy and preventing data leakage
- Evaluating model generalization abilities
- Understanding model behavior and limitations
- Identifying potential copyright infringement risks

## Critical Factors Affecting Memorization

Research reveals several key factors that influence memorization rates in LLMs:

- **Model Size**: Larger models memorize faster and retain more data (125M vs. 1.3B parameter models show 4× memorization rate gap) [1][6]
- **Data Duplication**: Repeated examples in training data increase memorization risk (log-linear relationship) [6]
- **Context Length**: Longer generation windows expose more memorized content [3][6]
- **Dataset Entropy**: Unique or rare information is more easily identified when memorized [4][5]

## Methods for Detecting Memorization

### 1. Perplexity-Based Detection

**Description**: Measures how surprised a model is by a given text sequence. Lower perplexity on a text segment indicates higher likelihood of memorization.

**Implementation**:
- Calculate per-token perplexity on suspected memorized content
- Compare against perplexity on known non-training data
- Identify statistical outliers that suggest memorization
- Apply token perplexity thresholds to identify memorized code snippets [3]

**Pros**:
- Works with both open and closed models (as long as token probabilities are accessible)
- Quantitative and easy to interpret
- Doesn't require model internals or training data access
- Particularly effective for code models (e.g., Codex, StarCoder) [3]

**Cons**:
- Requires access to token probabilities (may be unavailable for some closed models)
- May produce false positives for common/predictable content
- Threshold for memorization is subjective

### 2. N-gram Overlap Analysis

**Description**: Analyzes the overlap between model outputs and training corpus at the n-gram level.

**Implementation**:
- Extract n-grams from model outputs
- Compare against n-grams in reference datasets
- Calculate overlap statistics and identify exact matches

**Pros**:
- Simple to implement and understand
- Can work with black-box models
- Effective for detecting verbatim copying

**Cons**:
- Requires at least partial knowledge of training data
- May miss paraphrased or slightly modified content
- Computationally expensive for large corpora

### 3. Embedding Space Proximity

**Description**: Maps outputs to embedding space and measures distance to training examples.

**Implementation**:
- Generate embeddings for model outputs
- Compute similarity to embeddings of training data
- Flag outputs with unusually high similarity scores

**Pros**:
- Can detect semantic memorization beyond exact copying
- Works for paraphrased or restructured content
- More robust than exact string matching

**Cons**:
- Requires access to training data or representative proxies
- Higher computational requirements
- Similarity thresholds need careful calibration

### 4. Membership Inference Attacks

**Description**: Determines whether a specific data point was used in model training.

**Implementation**:
- Train a "shadow" model to classify if content was likely part of training data
- Use confidence scores and response patterns as features
- Apply statistical methods to detect outliers in model behavior

**Pros**:
- Theoretically sound with basis in privacy research
- Can work with black-box access to models
- Provides probabilistic certainty estimates

**Cons**:
- Requires substantial compute for shadow model training
- May have lower accuracy for very large models
- Needs careful experimental design

### 5. Prompt Engineering for Extraction

**Description**: Crafts specific prompts designed to trigger memorization.

**Implementation**:
- Design prefix prompts that might lead to memorized continuations
- Systematically probe model with truncated text from potential training sources
- Analyze completion patterns and consistency

**Pros**:
- Works with completely black-box models
- Can uncover unexpected memorization
- No need for training data access

**Cons**:
- Labor-intensive prompt design
- Success depends on prompt crafting skill
- May miss memorization that requires specific triggers

### 6. Gradient-Based Methods (for Open Models)

**Description**: Analyzes model parameter gradients when prompted with specific inputs.

**Implementation**:
- Measure influence of specific training examples on model parameters
- Identify parameters with unusual activation patterns
- Trace memorization to specific model components

**Pros**:
- Provides mechanistic insights into memorization
- Can locate memorization within model architecture
- Strong theoretical foundation

**Cons**:
- Only applicable to open-source models with parameter access
- Computationally intensive
- Requires deep understanding of model architecture

### 7. Benchmark Dataset Testing

**Description**: Tests models against deliberately held-out portions of known benchmarks.

**Implementation**:
- Curate examples from common benchmarks (e.g., C4, The Pile, Wikipedia)
- Prompt models with prefixes from these examples
- Measure exactness of continuation matching

**Pros**:
- Controlled experimentation environment
- Clear ground truth for evaluation
- Works with any accessible model

**Cons**:
- Limited to known benchmark datasets
- May not represent real-world memorization patterns
- Selection bias in choosing test examples

### 8. Dynamic Soft Prompt Extraction

**Description**: Trains a transformer-based generator to create input-dependent soft prompts that maximize verbatim data extraction from LLMs.

**Implementation**:
- Train a model to generate input-dependent soft prompts
- Use these prompts to maximize verbatim data extraction
- Measure using Exact Extraction Rate (ER) and Fractional ER metrics
- Adapts to input context, outperforming static prompts by up to 135.3% [2]

**Pros**:
- Adapts prompts per input to extract memorized text/code
- Highly effective for both text and code generation models
- Can work with closed models through API access

**Cons**:
- Requires training an additional transformer model
- More complex implementation than static prompts
- Computationally intensive training process

### 9. Entity-Level Memorization Analysis

**Description**: Quantifies memorization of specific entities (e.g., names, locations) using attribute-guided prompts.

**Implementation**:
- Use structured prompts like "The capital of [ENTITY] is" to test verbatim recall
- Measure success rates against dataset entropy (rare vs. common entities)
- Can achieve 61.2% accuracy in extracting unique entities from 6B-parameter models [5]

**Pros**:
- Focuses on high-value information like named entities
- Works well with both open and closed models
- Structured approach makes evaluation more standardized

**Cons**:
- May miss memorization of non-entity information
- Requires careful prompt design
- Results vary based on entity popularity/rarity

### 10. Verbatim Row/Feature Completion Tests

**Description**: Tests for tabular data memorization through row and feature completion tasks.

**Implementation**:
- Implement row completion tests: Can the model reconstruct full dataset rows?
- Feature completion tests: Does it correctly fill in missing feature values?
- Adjust thresholds based on dataset entropy (e.g., high entropy medical data vs. low entropy in Iris dataset)
- Use tools like Tabmemcheck [4]

**Pros**:
- Specialized for structured/tabular data
- Clear metrics for evaluation
- Works with both open and closed models

**Cons**:
- Limited to tabular data domains
- May not generalize to unstructured text
- Requires baseline dataset entropy calculations

## Implementation Considerations

For a comprehensive memorization detection tool, we recommend:

1. **Multi-method approach**: Combine multiple detection methods for higher confidence
2. **Adaptable thresholds**: Allow customizable sensitivity settings
3. **Model-specific calibration**: Account for different model architectures and sizes
4. **Statistical validation**: Include significance testing to reduce false positives
5. **Interpretable reports**: Generate clear visualizations and explanations of results
6. **Data entropy assessment**: Calculate and account for dataset uniqueness when setting thresholds [4][5]
7. **Context-aware evaluation**: Adjust tests based on model size and training conditions [1][6]

## Mitigation Strategies

Research suggests several approaches to reduce memorization risks:

1. **Data Deduplication**: Removing duplicates from training sets reduces memorization by ~30% [3][6]
2. **Forgetting Baselines**: Monitor tokens forgotten during training—larger models forget less [1]
3. **Entropy Weighting**: Adjust thresholds based on dataset uniqueness [4][5]
4. **Differential Privacy**: Apply DP techniques during model training to limit memorization [6]

## Ethical Considerations

When using this tool, consider:

- Responsible disclosure if potentially sensitive memorized content is discovered
- Balancing evaluation needs with potential privacy implications
- Recognizing that some memorization is expected and even necessary
- Proper attribution when testing with copyright materials
